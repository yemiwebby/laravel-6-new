# What’s new in Laravel 6.0

## Introduction

Laravel is undoubtedly the most popular PHP framework in the world at the time of writing. It has a reputation for making work easier for PHP developers (artisans) with a proper MVC structure, helper functions and an incredible syntax that makes it adopted by the community. With over 54k stars on GitHub and still increasing, there is definitely a reasonable future and more features to help developers get creative.

The last LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Laravel was 5.5 with bug fixes and support for many years. So far, the Laravel team has been consistent with improving the framework by introducing new features and more tools since version 5. 
It's about that time again for more amazing features and the team at Laravel didn’t disappoint as they have released a new Laravel 6.0 (LTS), which comes with features to improve on the last version. Here are some of the new features included in Laravel 6.0.
